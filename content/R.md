# **[What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)**  
**Is R the right tool for your data analysis needs?** 

## 1. A software for statistical computing and graphics

R vs other statistical software such as SPSS, SAS, STATA, Mplus, HLM etc. :

### Pros
* <b>Accessibility</b>: R is free and open-source, while other statistical software like SPSS is proprietary software that requires expensive licenses.  <br>
* <b>Extensibility</b>: R has tons of packages available for users to download and use in their analysis. A lot of developers actively maintain their packages and many develop new packages for noval state-of-art analysis.  <br>
(Optional: [Table of available packages in CRAN, sorted by date of publication](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html))  <br>
* <b>Flexibility</b>: R is highly customizable. You can customize plots, functions or even develop packages for your own needs.  <br>
(Optional: [An interesting metaphor](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/preface.html#:~:text=Busses%20are%20very,SPSS.%20%2D%20Greg%20Snow))  <br>
* <b>Reproducibility</b>: R code for data manipulation and analysis can be written and saved in scripts, which can be run anytime to reproduce the results given the raw data and scripts.  <br>
(Optional: [A reproducible example](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2022-021/#example-gb-rainfall-paper)  
[CRAN Task View: Reproducible Research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html))  <br>
* <b>Popularity</b>: R has a larger and more active user community, which provides a wealth of resources and support.  <br>

### Cons
* <b>User-friendliness</b>: Other statistical software like SPSS is generally considered to be more user-friendly and easier to learn than R, particularly for users with no programming experience.  <br>
* <b>Authority</b>: A poorly written or unreliable R package is risky, leading to errors or incorrect results. When you are unsure whether a package is trustworthy, it is recommended to check for its popularity, author reputation, and whether it is well-documented, peer-reviewed and actively maintained.  <br>

## 2. A programming language for statistical computing and graphics

R is a specialized language designed for statistical computing and graphics. It is not a general-purpose programming language for software and web development. However, Python, a general-purpose programming language, is popular for data analysis and shares some of R's features like open source and a strong community. It can be a hard call if you want to choose only one.
