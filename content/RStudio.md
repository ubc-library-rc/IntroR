# **[What is RStudio?](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)**

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, designed to provide a powerful and user-friendly interface for working with R. When you use RStudio, R executes the commands in the background. You must install R to use RStudio, but you can use R without RStudio.

Note. The RGui is the original R user interface. We will use RStudio instead, to access R during the workshop.

The RStudio interface has a toolbar and four main panes:
* On the very top, you can find a **toolbar** with buttons such as File, Code, View, Plots, etc.
* On the top left is the **Source Editor**. If it is your first time opening R Studio, the source editor may not show up. You can click from the toolbar 'File - New File - R Script' and then a script file called Untitled1 will show up there. Writing your code in the script is recommmended if you want to save your work for future use.
* On the bottom left is the **Console**. It is where you can type in R commands and see the outputs. Writing your code in the console is recommended for quick exploration.
* The top right pane includes tabs such as Environment and History. The **Environment** tab allows you to see what objects are in the workspace.  The **History** tab allows you to see the commands that you have entered.
* The bottom right pane shows tabs such as Plots, Packages and Help. **Plot** is where you can view your plot. **Packages** is where you can view the list of all the installed packages. In **Help**, you can can browse the built-in help system of R, which is super helpful.

If you have questions after the workshop, a cheat sheet is available for quick referral: [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rstudio-ide-1.pdf). The cheat sheet is also accessible within RStudio through the toolbar 'Help - Cheat Sheets - RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet'.
