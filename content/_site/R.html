<p>R vs other statistical software such as SPSS, SAS, STATA, Mplus, HLM etc. :</p>

<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Accessibility</b>: R is free and open-source, while other statistical software like SPSS is proprietary software that requires expensive licenses.  <br /></li>
  <li><b>Extensibility</b>: R has tons of packages available for users to download and use in their analysis. A lot of developers actively maintain their packages and many develop new packages for novel state-of-the-art analysis.  <br />
(Optional: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html">Table of available packages in CRAN, sorted by date of publication</a>)  <br /></li>
  <li><b>Flexibility</b>: R is highly customizable. You can customize plots, functions or even develop packages for your own needs.  <br />

  <li><b>Reproducibility</b>: R code for data manipulation and analysis can be written and saved in scripts, which can be run anytime to reproduce the results given the raw data and scripts.  <br />

</ul>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>User-friendliness</b>: Other statistical software like SPSS is generally considered to be more user-friendly and easier to learn than R, particularly for users with no programming experience.  <br /></li>
  <li><b>Authority</b>: A poorly written or unreliable R package is risky, leading to errors or incorrect results. When you are unsure whether a package is trustworthy, it is recommended to check for its popularity, author reputation, and whether it is well-documented, peer-reviewed and actively maintained.  <br />

<p>R is a specialized language designed for statistical computing and graphics. It is NOT a general-purpose programming language for software and web development. However, Python, a general-purpose programming language, is popular for data analysis, and shares some of R’s features like open source and a strong community. It can be a hard call if you want to choose only one. Each of them have certain strengths:</p>
