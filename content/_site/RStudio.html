<p>RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, designed to provide a powerful and user-friendly interface for working with R. When you use RStudio, R executes the commands in the background. You must install R to use RStudio, but you can use R without RStudio.</p>

<p>Note. The RGui is the original R user interface. We will use RStudio instead, to access R during the workshop.</p>

<p>The RStudio interface has a toolbar and four main panes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the very top, you can find a <strong>toolbar</strong> with buttons such as File, Code, View, Plots, etc.</li>
  <li>On the top left is the <strong>Source Editor</strong>. If it is your first time opening R Studio, the source editor may not show up. You can click from the toolbar ‘File - New File - R Script’ and then a script file called Untitled1 will show up there. Writing your code in the script is recommmended if you want to save your work for future use.</li>
  <li>On the bottom left is the <strong>Console</strong>. It is where you can type in R commands and see the outputs. Writing your code in the console is recommended for quick exploration.</li>
  <li>The top right pane includes tabs such as Environment and History. The <strong>Environment</strong> tab allows you to see what objects are in the workspace.  The <strong>History</strong> tab allows you to see the commands that you have entered.</li>
  <li>The bottom right pane shows tabs such as Plots, Packages and Help. <strong>Plot</strong> is where you can view your plot. <strong>Packages</strong> is where you can view the list of all the installed packages. In <strong>Help</strong>, you can can browse the built-in help system of R, which is super helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions after the workshop, a cheat sheet is available for quick referral: <a href="https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rstudio-ide-1.pdf">RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet</a>. The cheat sheet is also accessible within RStudio through the toolbar ‘Help - Cheat Sheets - RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet’.</p>
