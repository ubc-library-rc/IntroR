# Welcome to Intro to R and RStudio (Part 1 and Part 2)

R is popular for many applications including data visualization and statistical analysis. This beginner orientation is suitable for people with little or no R experience. It will help you decide whether R is the right tool for your data analysis needs and introduce R terminology using the RStudio interface.
See the UBC library Research Commons [event calendar](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/events/) for related workshops or [workshop materials](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/) on intermediate and advanced topics.

Participants are expected to have installed the latest versions of R and RStudio on their computers before the workshop:
Install R from [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
Install RStudio from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
